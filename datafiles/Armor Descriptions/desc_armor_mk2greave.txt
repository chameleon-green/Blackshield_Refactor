MKII "Crusade" pattern power armor was the first fully enclosed model, 
intended to carry the newly founded Imperial Asartes legions beyond the confines of Terra. 
The greaves contain powerful electrically motivated fiber bundles and servoes which increase
the wearer's strength and speed, as well as gyroscopic stabilization devices and electromagnetic
boots. However, when unpowered, the heavy armor will slow movement speed.

Crusade pattern extremity armor is composed of interlinked flexible casings which increase
flexibility but complicates repair.
