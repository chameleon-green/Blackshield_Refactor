MKII "Crusade" pattern power armor was the first fully enclosed model, 
intended to carry the newly founded Imperial Asartes legions beyond the confines of Terra. 
The vambraces contain powerful electrically motivated fiber bundles and servoes which 
increase the strength and speed of the wearer, and the large profile pauldrons can be used
to shield the torso.

Crusade pattern extremity armor is composed of interlinked flexible casings which increase
flexibility but complicates repair.
