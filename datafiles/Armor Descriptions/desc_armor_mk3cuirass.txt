MKIII "Iron" pattern power armor is a specialized upgrade of the MKII, featuring
greatly enhanced frontal protection. This mark was originally designed for brutal close quarters
combat such as tunnel warfare and starship boarding actions. Additional plasteel and ceramite 
plating has been affixed over the original MKII chassis, substantially improving survivability but 
greatly increasing weight and noise. The cuirass contains the armor's main fusion reactor, 
located in the backpack. Without it, other critical parts of the armor such as servos and
sensors will not function.


The cuirass powerplant was not improved despite the additional weight. As a result, MKIII
armor runs hotter and slower than its predecessor, but offers the highest level of protection
out of any conventional power armor mark.
