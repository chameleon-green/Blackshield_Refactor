MKII "Crusade" pattern power armor was the first fully enclosed model, 
intended to carry the newly founded Imperial Asartes legions beyond the confines of Terra. 
Segmented flexible casings allow for greater agility than some future models, 
but substantially complicates repairs. The cuirass contains the armor's main fusion reactor, 
located in the backpack. Without it, other critical parts of the armor such as servos and
sensors will not function.


The cuirass protects the torso from most man portable weapons. It will fail against 
heavier systems.
