MKII "Crusade" pattern power armor was the first fully enclosed model, 
intended to carry the newly founded Imperial Asartes legions beyond the confines of Terra. 
The helm contains life support, auspex and communications equipment, improving situational
awareness and unit cohesion. Auto-senses that interface directly with the wearer's nervous
system allow the user to see, smell, feel, taste and hear as though the armor were not there
at all. 

The neck joint of the MKII armor is less flexible than later models due to comparitively 
primitive neural link technologies.
