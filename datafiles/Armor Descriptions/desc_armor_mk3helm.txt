MKIII "Iron" pattern power armor is a specialized upgrade of the MKII, featuring
greatly enhanced frontal protection. This mark was originally designed for brutal close quarters
combat such as tunnel warfare and starship boarding actions. Additional plasteel and ceramite 
plating has been affixed over the original MKII chassis, substantially improving survivability but 
greatly increasing weight and noise.

The helm contains life support, auspex and communications equipment, improving situational
awareness and unit cohesion. Auto-senses that interface directly with the wearer's nervous
system allow the user to see, smell, feel, taste and hear as though the armor were not there
at all. The angular faceplate design of the MKIII would inspire the design of the later MKIV
"Maximus" pattern power armor.
