Chain weapons use a high-speed chain covered in monomolecular bladed teeth to tear apart 
their target. They are horrifically effective against soft targets, though they struggle 
against heavy armor. Their heavy weight (owing to their rugged drive systems) and shrieking 
teeth mean that chain weapons scale well with strength and easily stagger their opponents.

The Thunderedge-pattern chainsword was standard issue in the Astartes Legions of 31st 
millenium. It is a brutal, heavy weapon meant to face the alien horrors of the Great Crusade. 
Though it lacks some of the finesse of later designs, it makes up for this in sheer killing 
power.
