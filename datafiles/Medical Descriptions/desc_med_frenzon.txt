Frenzon is an extremely rare and powerful combat drug. It massively boosts one's
abilities, but quickly causes serious damage to the user's body as it wreaks havoc
on its chemical balance and biomechanical systems. It is most often used by Imperial
assassins of the Eversor clade, whose specially engineered metabolisms are designed
to handle the biological load of such a potent drug.
