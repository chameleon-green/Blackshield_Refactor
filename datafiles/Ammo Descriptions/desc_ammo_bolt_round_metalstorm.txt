Bolts are self propelled, armor piercing rounds with a mass-reactive fuse and high explosive filler.
They pierce their target before exploding, maximizing the damage of their warhead and
gruesomely blowing their apart target from the inside out. There are few types of personal 
armor that can defeat bolter rounds; even Astartes power armor will quickly fail under 
a hail of bolts. 

Metalstorm rounds eschew their armor-piercing core for a proximity sensor and enhanced
explosive payload. While they lose much of their armor penetration capability, they are
effective against hordes of soft targets.
