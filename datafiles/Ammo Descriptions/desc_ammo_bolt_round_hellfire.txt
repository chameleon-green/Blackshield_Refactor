Bolts are self propelled, armor piercing rounds with a mass-reactive fuse and high explosive filler.
They pierce their target before exploding, maximizing the damage of their warhead and
gruesomely blowing their apart target from the inside out. There are few types of personal 
armor that can defeat bolter rounds; even Astartes power armor will quickly fail under 
a hail of bolts. 

Hellfire bolt rounds replace the standard mass reactive fuse and explosive filler with 
a chamber of razor sharp needles suspended in a solution of mutagenic acids and deadly 
viruses, making them lethal against any kind of organic target.

Hellfire rounds deal biohazard damage with a 3.00x multiplier, with an armor penetration
rate of 0.
