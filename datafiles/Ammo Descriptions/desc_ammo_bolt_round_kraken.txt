Bolts are self propelled, armor piercing rounds with a mass-reactive fuse and high explosive filler.
They pierce their target before exploding, maximizing the damage of their warhead and
gruesomely blowing their apart target from the inside out. There are few types of personal 
armor that can defeat bolter rounds; even Astartes power armor will quickly fail under 
a hail of bolts. 

Kraken bolt rounds replace the standard mass reactive fuse and explosive filler with a
solid adamantite penetrator core, and use an improved kicker charge/rocket motor. 

Kraken bolts confer a 1.25 damage modifier, a 1.6 velocity modifier and a 0.33 penetration modifier
