Autocannon shells are large ballistic rounds used in autocannons.

APFSDS (Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) rounds utilize a subcaliber 
penetrator composed of pyrophoric alloys encased in a disposable sabot. A natural 
evolution of the HVAP round, APFSDS rounds shed the outer jacket entirely during flight 
to allow for even greater muzzle velocities.

APFSDS rounds have a 1.00 armor piercing modifier, 1.10 damage modifier and a 1.2
velocity modifier.
