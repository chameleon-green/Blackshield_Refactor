Bolts are self propelled, armor piercing rounds with a mass-reactive fuse and high explosive filler.
They pierce their target before exploding, maximizing the damage of their warhead and
gruesomely blowing their apart target from the inside out. There are few types of personal 
armor that can defeat bolter rounds; even Astartes power armor will quickly fail under 
a hail of bolts. 

Bolt shells are a larger version of bolt rounds, used in heavy bolters.

Standard bolt shells do not have any special effects, and deal 1.00x physical damage of 
the weapon they are used in.
