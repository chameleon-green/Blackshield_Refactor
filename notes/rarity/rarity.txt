HOW IT WORKS

Rarity/tech level is encoded as a string.
Rarity in text, tech in numbers.
Example: rarity = "uncommon.100"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

RARITIES

Common (white/yellow)
Uncommon (blue)
Rare (green)
Epic (purple)
Legendary (orange)

Shops determine their inventories based on their max tech level. Note that items
can have intermediate tech levels to add granularity if needed. A boltgun for example
may have a common rarity. However, a low tech hive gundealer will not be able to stock
astartes-pattern wargear; despite the low rarity rating, it's tech level will exceed the merchant's
tech level.

Auto/stub weapons, chainswords and flamers are plentiful and easy to manufacture (000-300)
Laser weapons are slightly more advanced but still quite common (300-600)
Bolt weapons are fairly advanced weapons, but still accessible (600-900)
Melta/plasma and power weapons are hard to acquire  (900-1200)
Power armor is extremely advanced and hard to find (1200-1500)
Advanced relic gear like iron haloes and personal shields are even rarer (1500-1800)
Terminator armor and other archaeotech are near impossible to acquire (1800+)

All astartes-grade gear is additionally 300 points higher than "normal", i.e. an astartes flamer
would be 300-600 tech level, and an astartes boltgun would be 1200-1500
